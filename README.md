This is about simple react things as begginer.
<h3>Quick Overview</h3>

npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, so uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
